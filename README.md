## 1. Course Description

This course encompasses an introduction to brain imaging data as a form of clinical data, elucidation of processing methodologies for brain imaging data in the context of artificial intelligence model development, and hands-on practice in constructing artificial intelligence models based on brain imaging data across three distinct topics.


## 2. Prerequisites

Prerequisites for this course include a foundational understanding of statistical principles at the undergraduate level and proficiency in scientific programming languages such as Python.


## 3. Course Format

Lecture	60%
Discussion/Presentation	40%

This course is structured in two phases: initially, lectures provide a comprehensive introduction to brain imaging data acquisition and elucidate processing methodologies; subsequently, students engage in hands-on development of artificial intelligence models based on brain imaging data across three distinct topics. The course culminates in student presentations and discussions, focusing on the predictive performance and outcomes of the implemented models.


## 4. Course Objectives

This course aims to impart a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles and processing methodologies of brain imaging data, while enhancing students' expertise and practical experience in developing artificial intelligence models based on brain imaging data.
